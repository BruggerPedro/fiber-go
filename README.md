## Starting

To get started with Fiber, simply install it with Go:

```


After installing Fiber, you can create a new web application by calling the 'New()' function:

    app := fiber.New()


Now that you have a new application, you can start adding routes and handlers:

    app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
        return c.SendString("Hello, World!")
    })


Finally, you can start your application by calling the 'Listen()' function:

    app.Listen(":3000")
